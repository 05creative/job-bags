# Job Bag Worflows

MacOS Automator workflow to create job bags easily.

## How to use it:

### Making Job Bags

1. Right click on a client folder and select `New Job Bag` (near the bottom)
2. Enter the name for the new job bag folder in the prompt that appears
3. Feel smug :smirk:
4. (Optional) Open `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts`
  Scroll down to `Files and Folders` and find `New Job Bag`
  Click on `None then Add Shortcut` and create a keyboard shortcut (I use Shift + Cmd + J)

### Setup (only needs doing once)

1. <a href="https://github.com/05creative/job-bags/blob/main/workflow.zip" download="download">Download `workflow.zip`</a> and un-zip it
2. Open `Finder` and select `Go > Go to Folderâ€¦`
3. In the prompt, paste in `~/Library/Services` and hit Go
4. Drop both `.workflow` files into that folder
5. Start using it!
